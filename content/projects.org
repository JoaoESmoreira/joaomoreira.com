* Projects
In this section, you will find a collection of projects of the
different areas I’ve explored throughout my academic and personal
journey. My work encompasses *software engineering*, *data analysis*,
*artificial intelligence*, *web development*, and *system design*. 

Some of these projects were developed within academic courses, while
others were created proactively to deepen my understanding of the
technologies I’m most passionate about. From *low-level systems* to
*full-stack* applications, this space serves as a living portfolio of
my learning path. Feel free to explore and learn alongside me!
