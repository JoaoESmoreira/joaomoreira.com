* About
Joaoesmoreia.com is a site created by Joao ES Moreira.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the
Department of Informatics Engineering at the University of Coimbra,
where I am currently pursuing a Master's in Informatics Engineering,
specializing in Intelligent Systems. My master's thesis focuses on
service price search in multimodal transportation networks.

Throughout my academic journey, I have took opportunities to improve
my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills. I successfully
completed the non-degree courses "Competitive Programming I" and
"Competitive Programming II," which deepened my understanding of
problem modeling, heuristics, and meta-heuristics. As part of this
training, I participated in the Portuguese Inter-University
Programming Marathon (MIUP 2023) and the Southwestern Europe Regional
Contest (SWERC 2023).

I have developed strong proficiency in multiple programming languages,
including Python, C, C++, Java, and MATLAB. 

Additionally, I gained practical web development experience through my
involvement with the Academic Group of Informatics Students, where I
contributed to the creation of websites for departmental events. This
experience allowed me to enhance my skills in JavaScript and the React
framework.
