* Default of Credit Card Clients Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card clients
defaulting on their payments using machine learning techniques. The
dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is titled
"Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset".

The full repository and documentation can be found here: [[https://github.com/JoaoESmoreira/RP-Project/][Credit Card
Prediction Repository]].

** Technologies Used
To run the project correctly, the following technologies are required:
- python 3.10+
- scikitâ€‘learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

** Problem Statement
The problem at hand is a binary classification task, where the goal is
to predict whether a credit card client will default on their payments
(class 1) or not (class 0). This prediction is based on various
demographic and credit-related features provided in the dataset.

** Dataset
The dataset contains various features including:

- Limit Balance
- Gender
- Education
- Marital Status
- Age
- Payment history for the past six months (Sep 2005 - Apr 2005)
- Bill statement amounts for the past six months
- Previous payment amounts for the past six months

The target variable is "default.payment.next.month", which indicates
whether the client defaulted on their credit card payment in the
following month.

** Approach
1. Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to
   understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and
   visualize relationships between variables.
2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values,
   encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. Feature Selection and Reduction: Employ various techniques such as
   univariate feature selection, principal component analysis (PCA),
   and correlation analysis to select and reduce the dimensionality of
   features.
4. Model Building: Experiment with different classification algorithms
   including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests,
   Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Naive
   Bayes.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using
   appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall
   and area under the ROC curve.

** Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
