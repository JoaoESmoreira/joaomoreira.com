* Complex Systems - Predator-Prey Modelling

In recent years, complex systems, characterized by nonlinear and
dynamic interactions among multiple components, have provided fertile
ground for exploring emergent phenomena and understanding the
interplay between different entities. A remarkable example of such
phenomena is the predator-prey dynamics.

With this work, we aim to explore the duality of possible outcomes,
where populations may either coexist or face mutual extinction
depending on interactions and environmental conditions. Through the
proposed simulation, we seek to establish a simplified parallel to
what occurs in nature, highlighting how small changes can disrupt
ecosystems and lead to species extinction. We recognize that nature
maintains a fragile balance, whose understanding is crucial for the
conservation and preservation of biodiversity. By analyzing the
obtained results, we aim to gain insights into the underlying
mechanisms governing predator-prey dynamics in complex systems, thus
contributing to a deeper understanding of emergent phenomena within
these systems.

** Proposed Model
This model presents three distinct types of agents: wolves
(predators), sheep (prey), and grass (the sheepâ€™s energy source), all
located on a grid.

Characteristics of wolves and sheep:
- *Movement:* Agents randomly choose a position in their Moore
  neighborhood and move to that position.

- *Energy:* Agents consume energy to move, which can be replenished
  when they feed.

- *Feeding:* Sheep feed on grass, while wolves feed on sheep when they
  occupy the same cell.

- *Reproduction:* An agent can reproduce by dividing into two
  individuals, with energy equally split between them.

- *Death:* Agents die if they run out of energy. Sheep may also die
  when eaten by wolves. Grass regrows in each cell at a constant
  rate. It is important to note that updates occur asynchronously,
  following the order in which agents were added to the environment.

In this model, the following parameters can be modified:
- Number of individuals
- Reproduction rate
- Energy gained from food
