Here, you'll find an informal collection of notes and explorations on
topics I'm currently learning about. From Linux configurations and
Emacs customizations to various software projects, this space serves
as a personal log of discoveries and experimentsâ€”not intended for
academic publication, but rather as a place to document my journey and
share practical insights. Feel free to explore and learn alongside me!
