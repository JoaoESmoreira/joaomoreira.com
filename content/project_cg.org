* Computer Graphics project
CG-Proj is a computer graphics project developed for the Computer
Graphics course within the the Informatics Engineering curriculum at
the University of Coimbra. The project demonstrates real-time
rendering, lighting, camera control, and interactive manipulation of
scene parameters.

The full repository and documentation can be found here:  
[[https://github.com/JoaoESmoreira/CG-Project/][Computer-Graphics-Project Repository]].

* Technologies Used  
- C and C++ (project is implemented mainly in C++).  
- OpenGL
- Make utility for build automation.


* Features  
- Real-time rendering of 3D geometry with different materials.  
- Switchable lighting sources: spot light and bulb (point) light.  
- Interactive control of camera orientation and position.  
- Adjustable RGB intensities for lights.  
- Mesh point toggling (show/hide mesh vertices).  
- Multiple predefined camera positions (front, back, left, right).

** Build & Run  
In the =src= directory there is a Makefile that you can use to manage
compilation and execution. The typical commands are:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
# run the code with:
make

# compile the code with:
make compile

# clean bin and object files with:
make clean
#+end_src
