* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on the *time series analysis* of mean temperature
data for a selected location. The goal is to model and forecast
temperature trends using different time series analysis techniques,
including exponential smoothing and other machine-learning methods, to
assess their predictive accuracy.

In addition to forecasting mean temperature, we extend the analysis by
incorporating multivariate models that consider other weather
variables. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding
of the relationships between different weather factors, ultimately
leading to more reliable forecasts.

** Technologies Used
To run the project correctly, the following technologies are required:
- python 3.10+
- scikit‑learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

** Data

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the Open-Meteo
Historical Weather API, which provides daily weather observations for
various locations worldwide. For this analysis, we selected data from
Tokyo for the period spanning from January 1st, 1940, to the present.
The primary variable of interest is the mean daily temperature,
supplemented with additional weather variables for multivariate
analysis.  

The dataset contains daily observations structured with a
date column and corresponding values for each weather variable.


** Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories to maintain
clarity and separation of concerns throughout the project:

- *src/* – Contains all the project’s source code, including scripts and
  Jupyter notebooks. This is where the main logic and implementation
  of the project are developed.

- *data/* – Stores all datasets and input files used in the
  experiments. 

- *docs/* – Holds documentation/report files

- *delevery/* – Includes final deliverables such as reports,
  slides, and results ready for submission or presentation.

- *requirements.txt* – Lists all dependencies required to run the
  project in a reproducible environment.


This structure ensures that the project remains modular, easy to
navigate, and reproducible across different environments.
