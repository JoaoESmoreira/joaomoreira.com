* Human-Computer Interaction

This project was developed as part of the Human-Computer Interaction course and focuses on designing and implementing an interactive web application that emphasizes usability, accessibility, and user-centered design principles.

The system integrates both frontend and backend components, combining responsive interface design with real-time communication and data visualization. A key feature of the application is the use of an interactive map, allowing users to explore and interact with geospatial information intuitively.
