This project aims to setup my personal webpage available at [[][]].

** Build
All the website content is written in *Org Mode* and organized under
the =content/= directory.  This format allows for clean, structured
writing while leveraging the full power of the Emacs ecosystem.

The [[file:build-site.el][build-site]] script is responsible for converting these =.org= files
into HTML and exporting them into the =public/= directory, which
serves as the final output of the site.

** Licence
This project is licensed under the [[file:LICENSE][MIT License]].
